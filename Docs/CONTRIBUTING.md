## Developing 💻

> All new features must have tests.
### 1. **BEFORE YOU START**

To setup your testing environment:

1. Set environment variable `CAPI_KEY` to you Clockify API key.

or

1. Copy `.runsettings.default` to `.runsettings`
    > `.runsettings` is in `.gitignore` so don't worry
1. Change `your_clockify_api_key` to your own Clockify API key. See [API docs](https://clockify.me/developers-api) for instruction.
1. Set `.runsettings` as your test settings file.

> Test naming convention `MethodName_ShouldDoSomething()`

### 2. Writing actual code

#### For newcomers

Just create **pull request**.

>I really recommnend [this](https://opensource.com/article/19/7/create-pull-request-github) article.

    * `git checkout -b feature/myFeatureName`
1. Now setup upstream using

1. Now is time to code (my favorite).
1. After you done commit your changes
    * `git add .`
    * `git commit -m "Your commit message"`
1. Now go to https://github.com/Morasiu/Clockify.Net and click **Compare & pull request**.
